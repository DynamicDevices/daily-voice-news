Flu season is hitting the United States hard, with certain regions experiencing particularly severe outbreaks. Health officials are tracking which states are seeing the highest infection rates and hospitalizations as the virus spreads rapidly across the country.

Medical experts encourage everyone to get vaccinated if they haven't already, practice good hand hygiene, and stay home when feeling ill to help slow transmission.
