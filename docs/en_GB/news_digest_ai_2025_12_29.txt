In New Jersey, a fatal mid-air collision between two helicopters resulted in one death and another person injured, with investigators working to determine the cause of the crash.

In health news...

Britain is bracing for a significant cold snap as the new year begins, prompting authorities to issue amber health alerts across several regions. The frigid temperatures pose particular risks for vulnerable populations, including elderly residents, young children, and those with existing medical conditions. Health officials are urging people to check on at-risk neighbors and family members, keep homes adequately heated, and watch for signs of cold-related illness. The weather system is expected to persist for several days into early January.

In climate news...

Skywatchers have reason to celebrate, as scientists predict exceptional viewing opportunities for the Aurora Borealis in 2026. The sun is approaching the peak of its eleven-year activity cycle, which means more solar storms will send charged particles toward Earth's magnetic field. These interactions create the stunning light displays we know as the Northern Lights. The increased solar activity should make the auroras visible at lower latitudes than usual, giving more people a chance to witness this natural phenomenon.
